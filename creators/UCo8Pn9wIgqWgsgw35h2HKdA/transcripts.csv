03cK-szT_HA,online personal trainers they claim they can transform your body right through the screen but what's it really like to put them to the test that's where I come in I hir three life personal trainers on Fiverr with one goal to see if they're actually worth it and who create the best workout routine for me whoever wins gets 500 bucket roomies first up was ad dtia his session cost $115 and let's just say he was worth every Buck he had the best motivation I've ever seen and overall I think we had a very solid connection next was Jake for only $35 he created a full workout plan for me and made sure we went to failure on pretty much every set also I had the best CH of pump after the workout so bonus points and finally Donovan for a whopping $90 Donovan calculated every single rep and weight we would use and also showed me workouts for muscle groups I didn't even know existed I was shocked after training with all these personal trainers I can definitely say they're worth it especially if you're new to the gym or need an accountability partner but who won I guess you'll just have to find out by watching this video
Abn2hGspOEw,so if you want to start working out from home here are three inexpensive must-haves that help my body get from this to this the first one up is a door attached pull apart these are like 20 dollars really inexpensive and they can hit muscle groups like back arms and abs pretty good my second recommendation is adjustable dumbbells so they're like 60 to 100 and with this you could hit every muscle group thoroughly aside from chest which leads me into my third recommendation which is adjustable weight bench with a bench you can hit movements like an incline or regular chest press with these three things you pretty much have a full gym in your house but I would still recommend going to the gym just for the community and having that motivation but I must say working out by yourself for a long period of time does get boring but other than that having home gym is amazing and you should just have fun with it bye-bye
yAR_StHrEr0,hey my name is Nick and lately my life has just been on repeat wake up grab phone scroll for hours rethink life you know maybe I shouldn't be on my phone all day huh who cares do some meaningful work and then finally head back to sleep anyways I'm in a rut I'm sure you've all been there a time where it feels like nothing goes your way especially your bank account if I want to reach my goal of being able to enjoy a personal toilet in an aquarium room so big that I start thinking I'm in the aquarium but for the fish then I know I need a lock in that aquarium room ain't paying for itself so in today's video I'll be embarking on the world's most productive month where I get my bag up my happiness up and my looks up well that's the goal anyways so what's the plan first no phone if I want to become a productive man I need to get away from Doom scrolling and all of these notifications running at 510 a.m. every morning cold showers every day working out every day meditation for 20 minutes every day reading every day create a priority list every day and no Digital entertainment for the Whole 30 days I know I'm going to regret that one I'll also be doing some practices from Andrew huberman Jordan Peterson and David gogin the productivity Pros to make sure I'm the most productive I can be let's do it good morning guys it's 5:00 a.m. I'm not ready for the day I hate waking up at 5:00 I just closed my eyes I woke up oh it's time to run it's time to run let's let's just let's just do it I mean get get over with 30 minute run I mean how how bad could it be Oh but before that this bad boy is going away why do I even do this to myself it's too early for this but running Starts Now I need to put my camera away [Music] I've never felt so like sleepy and awake at the same time that's okay that's why we have a cold shower right after this to fix that okay cold shower done you know I don't think it was terrible a little bit I'm definitely very wide awake right now my body's Wide Awake Wide wake next up we have meditation for 20 minutes I'm going to be doing transcendental meditation yeah I mean after like the intense intense I'm ready just to Deo de load let's do it meditation is done I felt like all the impurities were just melting off my face pretty cool I got a glimpse of sleep in there and I was like wow man I I just want to take a big nap but nap is for the for the for the week okay anyways our next non-negotiable is planning out our day so let's do it after I finished planning my day I then proceeded to get a chest and tricep workout in and then continue to work until night day one is complete yay I'm feeling like Shakespeare right now I'm feeling good I'm feeling like I did a lot and I want to continue this I'm going to go read a book and then go to sleep so I'll see you later although it seemed like this challenge was going great I lowkey forgot my girl mother nature existed and that would become a problem go everyone we got a problem it's 5:00 a.m. and I'm about to go on my run but it's raining and I don't know about you but who wants to go on a run when it's raining at 5:00 a.m. not this guy well so today I guess I just won't be going on my run I wish the water was cold they know me son [Music] you know it it was raining all right you know just a little drizzle out there yeah just just a little drizzle I'm only a little bit wet too and the challenge just seem to be getting worse I'm I'm tired all I want to do is watch am I focused you focus focus leio focus as you can see I might have been going a little bit crazy all I've wanted to do has been watching my favorite show but I can't I got no Digital entertainment I can read my book I can go study I can write more scripts I've also been like doing this thing where I'm not going out with my friends not hanging out cuz I really wanted to lock in for these 30 days man that sucks I don't know how I'm going to do these 30 days come on man yeah it's kind of crazy how you don't know you're addicted to something until it's gone but with a renewed motivation to look like my best friend Chris Bumstead I knew I had a lock in so I can make the best use of these 30 days cue the training [Music] [Music] Arc day 15 we're halfway there and I also want to share something that has made this challenge so much easier and that is why making productivity fun and also keeping myself organized and that's where this video sponsor comes in notion is basically this revolutionary productivity and organizing tool which I'm going to talk more about as I show you how I made the world's most productive month template that you can follow in the link in description notion is where I've been logging all my days all my to-do list and has really been the glue of this challenge also you can add Q stickers and highlights which lowkey just makes it a lot more fun think about it like Google Docs and Google Drives on steroids such a versatile workplace that helps you plan write and organize all your things so you can reach your full potential whether you're a student small business owner or someone who just just wants to improve notion is the site to use they also release notion AI so you can turn all your ideas into action summarize all your notes and get answers instantly so yeah go check them out okay let's get back to the [Music] challenge okay so if you're wondering what I do for fun I've been drawing Celsius let me show you my full collection like let me show you this that is the full sparkling Celsius collection okay trust me it's a lot more fun than it looks is it underlying a Celsius addiction maybe but who cares I'm drawing them that makes that makes up for it I think I don't know it's it's fun though I'm I'm vibing I'm vibing guys besides the concerning underlying Celsius addiction everything else was going great I was being more consistent with the gym and my physique started to see some improvements okay workout not feeling the best right now but I got a quote from Alex mosy that says you can't lose if you never quit and I ain't losing so we're just going to keep pushing no matter how bad the workout feels if you keep coming up consistently you're still going to see results so and with the days seemingly flying by it was finally day 30 Alexa Alexa stop good morning guys it's finally day 30 holy [ __ ] let's go do our last run I'm excited waking up at 5:00 a.m. really never gets easier oh my gosh oh my gosh this run is going to be [Music] easy AA gogins got nothing on me let's go to the cold shower [Music] okay so the game plan for today is just going to get some work done go to the gym and then I'm going to go play volleyball with my friends at like 6:00 p.m. which is a big deal like I have not been going out with my friends this whole entire 30 days you know working all the time going to cafes alone all that stuff just it's kind of lonely to be honest and while I did get a lot done I feel like I'm also cherishing a lot of the moments where I've had with my friends a lot more I'm excited for 600 p.m. volleyball well you're about to see me I'm like I'm like highq I think I'm I am kin kagiyama Fusion type [ __ ] I got [Music] this being super productive is super good you start getting your life together start getting your goals done and you start getting your bank up but sometimes we need to take a step back and realize what we're even working for what's the point of working so hard if you can't spend time with the people that you enjoy being [Music] with one of my biggest takeaways from this challenge is that it can get lonely trying to do it all by yourself so definitely be productive definitely try to achieve your goals try to get that bank up but also remember to have some time for your friends and family because truly friendship is the magic that keeps you going so overall what are the true benefits from trying the world's most productive month first is obviously the fact that you become so much more productive without the external stimuli that you're getting from your phone or Digital entertainment with technology nowadays our dopamine receptors are low-key fried and with our Baseline of dopamine being pushed so much higher than if what is supposed to be mundane tasks become boring but when we remove this external stimuli that we're getting from your phone from Digital entertainment our dopamine levels can return back to Baseline and things like reading working and just mundane tasks become so much more fun also just having a structure routine based on Personal Care is so good for you to start achieving your goals the second benefit is being alone with yourself and your thoughts nowadays we are barely alone with our thoughts except for those shower thoughts for me I was listening to podcast 24/7 trying to be the best version of myself but without this constant stimulation you can truly start understanding yourself your feelings start being more creative and just have more time to evaluate all of your choices this extra time you have to yourself is super super important and thirdly if you can conquer the world's most productive month your self-respect will Skyrocket this challenge is definitely super hard I definitely wanted to quit multiple times especially when the new episode of my show came out man that was hard to hold back but I didn't feel the challenge and I succeeded and now I know I have the self-respect for myself to lock in when I really have to this feeling of confidence and self-respect is something you can only really get by reaching your goals by overcoming Temptations and challenges you become stronger so I'm super glad I pushed myself to this level and I became stronger and my self-respect for myself and my confidence went up this challenge really opened up a lot of possibilities for me it made me much more productive and I'm going to use some of these habits I built for my day-to-day life even with a phone so should you try the world's most productive month in my opinion absolutely but maybe not for a month and just try it for a couple days I know not having your phone for 30 days is something a lot of people can't do I'm just a YouTuber and a student so I don't really need a phone but if you really want to achieve something and have the possibility of not using your phone for 30 days I would 100% recommend this challenge for you I truly believe if you stick with it for 30 days you will achieve any goal that you want the full template will be in the link in the description and one more big things to notion for sponsoring this video I hope you guys enjoy the video make sure to subscribe if you liked it and yeah I'll see you guys next time bye
Yzj04z5kJOI,the only three workouts I needed to get my chest from this to this the first one is bench press focusing on the lower chest it's great for muscle growth Progressive overload and it's overall just so fun you want to do three sets of 5 to 12 reps all till failure utilizing pause bench which is basically just pausing the bar on your chest before going back up the second movement primarily hitting the upper chest is incline dumball press with the emphasis on the upper chest and the enhanced range of motion this exercise is arguably the best one for building an aesthetic chest incorporate this into your routine by doing three sets of 6 to 12 reps all till failure finally machine chest flies or peex these are great for isolating your chest fully finishing them and giving you that enhanced range of motion focus on squeezing your elbows together at the end of the movement to fully feel that chest incorporate this into your routine by doing three sets of 8 to 15 reps all till failure you go build your boobies you guys got that bye
HBZlduiZFAQ,"at 14 years old I look like this yeah now you're average 14-year-old this physique actually blew up getting me over 95,000 subscribers so thanks younger me for doing that but how did I get so jacked was it steroids no I'm natural and plan to stay natural hey get that away from me was it a [Music] heartbreak no it's because I created this exact routine that I'll be sharing in today's video okay let me first clarify this routine is not just for 14-year-olds it can work for anyone although I did make it when I was 14 so it's probably not optimized but then again it's also the routine that made me look like a grown man at 14 so take that as you will I'll be breaking this video down into two parts my exact workout routine and the nutrition strategies that I implemented but first let's start with the workout routine starting off with my workout split I followed a chest try back by just try leg AB back by justest try back by routine now if you're familiar with a gym you will know that this is definitely not your standard pushpull leg routine and it might be lacking in legs but keep in mind I was 14 I didn't know legs were that important you may have also noticed I had no rest days which is contradictory to most workout routines however I believe I could do this because I was going through puberty my hormones were going crazy and I had super fast recovery time and I was on my Vengeance Arc however if you're not going through puberty or going through a vengeance Arc that forces you to go to the gym every day I would highly recommend taking rest days most research shows that rest days can lead to a 10 to 20% increase in muscle mass so take your rest days people okay let's break down what each category in my split consisted of first we have chest and triceps now guys don't call me weird but look at this I know I know they're massive and this is without Photoshop guys I surprise myself but this is just the result of this workout routine that I'm about to show you so lock in and fun fact at 14 at 133 lb I was already benching 225 so you know this bench routine works first I would do four warm-up sets and then I would move into pyramid sets de clarify pyramid sets is basically when you start off with high weight and low reps and as you work your way down the pyramid you start doing lower weight and higher reps so I do four sets of bench press the first set was a heavy set aiming for 3 to five reps all to failure the second and third set would be 5 to eight reps again all till failure finally for my fourth set I would do 8 to 12 reps till failure and then drop set to way I could do around 6 to 8 reps and yeah if you're new to the gym you might be wondering what drop sets are they're basically when you go to failure take off some weight and go to failure again but when I say failure I mean failure I don't mean stopping when you feel like you can't do another rep I mean stopping when you actually can't do another rep so make sure you have a spotter or spotter bars ready to catch your weight as you go to True failure or you'll end up like me anyways it's a pretty intense weight to start off my chest a but that's because I only did two exercises bench press and incline dumbbell press after warming up again again I would do my first set which consisted of 6 to 10 reps all till failure then I would do my second and third set 8 to 12 reps all till failure and then I'll do my last and fourth set 8 to 12 reps all to failure then drop setting again so pretty similar to bench press this chest routine really made sure that my pectoral muscles were popping out of my shirt now moving on to triceps I'd start with rope pull Downs I would do four sets all in the 8 to 12 rep range all going to failure and drops setting the last two sets so you can really feel your triceps and then to finish off my tricep workout I would do close grip bench press 6 to eight reps for three sets the strategy here was that I could end my chest and tricep workout with a chest pump and a tricep pump so I could take a really nice physique photo W stack guys also when you're training to failure and drop setting it is super important to stay hydrated that's why I reached out to element and politely asked them to sponsor this video element is an electroly drink without the sugar and other dodgy ingredients that other sports strings have but why is Nick yapping to you guys about electrolytes well besides the sponsorships electrolytes can help you function as your highest capacity in the gym maintain the fluid levels you need to lift super heavy and reduce the chances of getting muscle cramps so pretty much it means more gains actually when I was prepping for my world record bench press meet I was talking to Jen Thomson a world record in the bench press and she told me I needed to get my electrolytes up that's because you need the energy and hydration that comes from electrolytes to perform at your best and the reason I asked element to partner with me was one that I might be broke and two because they do it the best with nine sugar-free delicious flavors your mind and body will perform at peace weak level also with winter coming around they just released their limited time chocolate Melody which includes chocolate mint chocolate chai and chocolate raspberry which you can drink hot so you stay hydrated stay warm and maximize your gains but if you don't like their drink which is really unlikely you can get a 100% guarantee no questions asked return you don't even got to return the box that's how confident they are so if you do decide to get some element you can use my link to get a free sample pack it's drink lnt.com snicolas thanks element for sponsoring this video okay moving on to back and buy I would start off my workout with pull-ups I actually recommend doing lap pull downs but since I didn't have a gym membership the only thing I could do were pull-ups and the reason I would actually do lat pull Downs is because it's much easier to Progressive overload but both are great so I would do four sets of pull-ups and I wouldn't even count the rest because I would go to failure on each set and if I felt like challenging myself I would stack my book bag with a 45 lb weight and just Spam as many as I could then I'd move on to single arm dumbbell rows which I would do for around 8 to 12 Reps for like three sets and that's it of course I have a much more intense back day now but I had to make do with what I had back then anyways then I'd move on to biceps my bicep routine was actually pretty unique it's because it had a lot more exercises and a lot more variety than a lot of my other workouts first I do super curls I would do three sets for 8 to 12 reps and this exercise actually I wouldn't go to failure I would try to do 8 to 12 reps and have round two reps left in the tank that's just because there was so much volume we would then move on to preure curls which I would do two sets on each arm and go around 8 to 12 reps all to a failure then I move on to Incline double press which is around two sets 8 to 12 reps all to failure and finally I would end with this weird super set so I would do seven wide curls seven close curls and seven supernat curls you would really want to push the failure on this one so pick a weight you can do for around 21 reps and yeah the volume was pretty crazy on biceps I don't know why I probably was just having fun with it but you know I enjoyed it I enjoyed it which brings me to a point that enjoy your workouts are the most important so if you are trying to figure out which workouts you should do just do the ones that are most fun to you that's the Strat guys and with that back and buys are done okay now for the most exciting part of my workout routine leg day said no one yeah I don't think anyone's excited for leg day except for like a couple people who really like pain but if you want to grow a full Bakery back there you got to lock in legs are something you have to do so don't follow 14-year-old me and only do one leg day do two leg days in a week you got this guy I believe so starting with squats I would do squats pretty similar to how I would approach my bench press using pyramid sets after warming up my first set would be a heavy set with around 5 to eight reps and I wouldn't really push the failure on the first set cuz we're going to save that for later cuz going to failure on squats drains you like no one else my second set I would aim for around 6 to8 reps and my third set I would do 8 to 12 reps and this one I would go to failure and finally for my fourth set I would do 10 to 15 reps alt to failure and then I would drop set drop setting on squats is is like probably the most masochist thing you can do but like trust me guys it'll give you great results you won't be able to walk after but who needs to walk after if you have a bakery am I right okay now that you can't walk you're going to do Bulgarian split squats two sets on each leg 8 to 12 reps all till failure you really feel your glutes with this one also quick tip for late day if you make super aggressive unnecessary Grunts and super weird faces when hitting legs you probably triple the amount of gains you can make the more you know right okay so that wraps it up for leg day but you might have noticed I'm missing a couple muscle groups shoulders traps calves abs and forearms to be honest I would just sprinkle these in my workout routine for shoulders I would do lateral raises for traps I would do shrugs and for calvs I would do calf raises for abs I would just go crazy cuz I te window I would do like a thousand reps of leg raises yeah yeah I mean it really worked and for my forearms I would use these grip things or I would just get like away and curl like this so pretty fire pretty fire these workouts were kind of like spices to my Core workout whenever they weren't sore I would work them out and it would just be like a nice variety okay that concludes the workout routine that I made when I was 14 I definitely have a more optimized version if you want to check it out you can watch it on this video or I'll just link it in the bio of my thing so check it out now moving on to more important part nutrition did 14-year-old Nick meal prep absolutely not every time I stepped in the kitchen something would go in [Music] Flames anyways unlike current more Handsome and Rich Nick 14-year-old Nick was broke at 14 I had no money to meal prep so I would just eat whatever my mom made me if I wanted to cut I would ask my mom if I could eat less if I wanted to bulk I would eat more then to supplement my protein I would drink 60 to 90 G protein shakes which I do not recommend by the way do not taste good but I had to supplement my protein somehow but yeah I actually didn't do anything too special with my diet pair my mom's healthy vegetarian food and working out and boom you have a lean mass monster but for learning purposes let's talk about how to control your diet it's all about the principle calories and calories out adjust your calories whether you're bulking or cutting and then also adjust your protein if you're cutting I would recommend 1 to 1.2 g of protein per body weight if you're bulking I would recommend 6 to8 g of protein per body weight and if you're just maintaining I would recommend 8 to 1 G per pound of body weight this is just an estimate guys so feel free to do whatever you can but this doesn't mean just eat protein cookies you need to have a balanced healthy diet to perform at your best level also another key aspect I don't want you guys to overlook is that I had good lighting and good genetics pair my Unstoppable bathroom lighting with good genetics and you got an Unstoppable combo also I was only 133 lb in this photo so I wasn't huge or anything I was just lean so don't compare yourself to me everyone goes at their own level just be consistent keep working at it and you will get amazing results and there you have it that's how I got jacked at 14 reflecting back on it was it optimal no but did it work yeah do I follow a better routine now I think so anyways a big thanks to element for sponsoring this video you guys are a lifesaver and if you get some make sure to use the link in my bio I'll see you guys later love you guys"
EqUjWH7hHN8,hey guys my name is Nicholas burn growing up I've always been a skinny kid but despite that I managed to look like this at 14 and this at 17 but how did I manage to transform this into that well today I'll explain in three steps training diet and consistency let's do it okay first let's start off with a training split and for those who don't know training split is basically how you divide your workout throughout the week I follow the most standard workout pushpull legs which I've been using consistently for the past 5 years and has got me pretty good results so I'm not saying that it's the best or anything but it's pretty good but let's be honest for 50% of you this split is going to be push and pull because you guys don't hit your legs hit your legs trust me you do not want to end up like this guy what a loser okay let's talk about what pushpull legs even means push means hitting chest tricep and shoulders pull means hitting back and biceps and legs means hitting legs and abs and I do push pull legs two times a week having a one-day break in between each repeating cycle so it kind of looks like this okay first let's talk about my push routine which I do on Monday and Friday this routine is for guaranteed bigger boobies so pay attention I like to start off my workout with a pause bench press focusing on the lower chest which I do for three sets from 5 to 12 reps all to failure having a 2 to 3 minute rest interval in between pause bench in my opinion is just a better version of bench press just because of how much more it isolates your chest next I follow that up with a primarily upper chest movement the incline dumbbell press I do this for three sets from 6 to 12 reps all till failure having a 2 to 3 minute rest interval in between now you might be wondering what you do in this rest interval a pretty popular option is playing Clash Royale popularized by Sam suck which don't get me wrong it's a pretty good option but I personally choose to contemplate my life I have a lot of thoughts in the gym yep moving on we have our last movement fully isolating the chest which is PEC Tech or chest flies I like to finish off my chest by doing two to three sets of 8 to 14 reps all to failure having a 1 to 2 minute interval of rest in between each [Music] set and that's pretty much it for my push days so moving on to pool days which give you that demon back that yuir Roa type back all right I'm not saying anything but if you follow this routine you might be flying away with your Lots um it's pretty good I recommend it cuz I've been doing it so I might be biased but I think my back looks pretty good I really like to start off my back days with a compound movement which is lat pull Downs lat pull Downs are like pull-ups but it's more beginner friendly and you can overload it a little easier so I just do them but pull-ups are also a great option I do three sets of 5 to 12 reps Alti failure we are having a 2 to 3 minute interval of rest in between each set then I move on to a more upper back focus movement the t- bar row I like to do this for three sets for 5 to 12 reps Al to failure again having 2 to 3 minute interval in between each set and the last movement I like to do from my back is a single arm cable rows these are so good for your back like I feel like I have a ball of muscle that is just Contracting when I do this so if you do it right you're really going to feel it so I like to do three sets of this 5 to 12 reps all to f failure having a 1 to 2 minute interval of rest in between each set and what you really want to do is you really want to feel it this is not about lifting most weight this is about feeling the muscle this is all about my muscle Connection in this movement next I move on to the second part of the pool routine which is just biceps and I just do superator dumbbell curls three sets 5 to 12 reps alter failure having a 1 to 2 minute interval of reps in between and then finally finish off with preure curls doing two to three sets of 8 to 12 reps all to failure having a 1 to 2 minute interval of rest in between and there we go we're done with pool day and lastly the day that 50% of Jim Bros skit leg day trust me I understand how hard it is to walk upstairs or just to walk in general after a leg day but you got to do it you don't want to be one of those stickm stick stick man's stick leg big man yeah also I do my legs Wednesday and Sunday all right so I'd like to get started with a compound movement namely the hack squat or barbell squat I usually just do the hack squat because as less pressure on my lower back and that's something that really bothers me but if you don't I would honestly recommend doing the barbell squat so I'll do three sets of 6 to 12 reps all to failure having a 3 to 5 minute rest interval in between each set hitting legs especially hack squats to failure is super exhausting like I've had some friends whove tried to worked out with me and hit legs and we go to Absolute failure we go to failure we can't push up then we do partials and stuff like that and one of them threw up and one of them had to go home right after the heck squat set so you really need a lot of time to rest and between each side and also if you're a beginner I wouldn't recommend to go absolute failure on hack squats or any compound leg movement just because your body is not used to it but I would still train intense The Next Movement I like to do is the seated hamstring curls and I like doing this over the laying hamstring curls just because you get more of a stretch I'll do three sets of 6 to 12 reps all to failure having a 2 to 3 minute break between each set next I'll hop into leg extensions where I do three sets of 6 to 12 reps all to failure having a 2 to 3 minute interval in between each one also just a quick note for all of these workouts on the last set I drop set until I can't go anymore so I'll probably drop set like three times I especially do this on leg extensions because you really want your legs to be exhausted after this and lastly for my leg day I do calf raises I'll do three sets to six to 20 reps Alti failure having a 2 to 3 minute rest interval in between now there are two components in leg day legs and abs but I'm going be honest a lot of people don't hit ABS even though it is a really important muscle group and I don't even do any weights for ab workouts I usually just do hanging leg raises or I'll do crunches or something like that just something body weight that really gets my abs strengthened don't neglect your abs people get a strong core and your body will function so much better okay now that training is out of the way we are moving on to diet which is arguably the most important part your whole body revolves around the way you eat to put it simply if you want to lose weight you have to go into a calorie deficit and if you want to gain weight you have to go into a calorie Surplus and if you want to Max maximize the amount of gains you can get you should prioritize protein getting 7 to 1 g of protein per pound of body weight that you have but I know for a teenager controlling your diet is hard because you have parents who love you and give you delicious food tea all the time but you really don't need a specific meal routine to get jacked I mean I've never had a specific meal routine and look at me man I'm so buff so how did I do it I simply measure my weight and plan how I was going to eat accordingly if I was too heavy I would cut back on the high calorie dense foods and focus eating low calor dense foods like vegetables and fruits and if I was too light I would go on more high calorie dense foods like avocados and nuts just a quick side tangent the best way to lose weight is eating Naval oranges like these bad boys are like this big they're they're pretty big and they have like super low calories and they fill you up like you could have like five of them and you'll be okay and you'll probably be full or sick of eating but what are low and high calorie dense foods low calorie foods are foods that have a lot of water content so you get full without having a lot of calories and on the opposite hand high calorie dense foods are dense compared to the weight making it so much easier to consume more food while gaining more weight and on the opposite hand high calorie dense foods are really dense compared to their weight making it really easy to bulk up if you're still confused on this I have a full video on my homepage that you can go check out after this video so yeah so with this information you should start looking at the calories each product has and start subsidizing it for a better option whether you're trying to bulk or trying to cut but even though your weight is controlled by calories in and calories out it doesn't mean you can lose weight by eating a bunch of cookies even if you're in a deficit well I mean technically you can but that's not the right way to go at it you really need to have a balanced diet to really feel healthy and perform better if you're on cookies you're going to perform like [ __ ] and your workouts are going to be [ __ ] so don't train on cookies and actually have a balanced diet whether you're bulking or cutting also I really want to emphasize how important protein is without protein your body can't grow or recover muscles so get your protein intake in the general rule for this is about 7 G to 1 G per pound of body weight so just try to aim for this you can do it now on to the final most important part consistency all that I've talked about today doesn't matter if you're not consistent with your training or your diet the truth is it took me 2 years to get a decent physique and 5 years to get where I am at now I'm sure this is not your first time trying to get jacked you probably had that 3:00 a.m. motivation and started working out for a week or two before you stopped but that's not how you do it and I'm I'm sure you know that and I'm sure I don't need to tell you that but it's really not how you do it sure there are motivational tricks like starting off small small wins lead to big wins or changing the goal from working out to putting on workout clothes which are all really helpful but it all comes down to self-respect and what I mean by self-respect is having the respect for yourself to keep up with your wishes whether that's being consistent with a gym or doing something else next time you feel like you don't want to go to the gym or you don't want to work out I want you to record yourself and play it back really think about if that's the person you want to be and really remember why you started working out in the first place keep going at it in a month you'll start seeing results in 6 months you'll start gaining confidence and in a year you'll start getting compliments it's all about consistency and taking your time with it and I know it's cliche but you got to enjoy the journey and not the results that's what this whole workout thing is all about okay that's all for this video if you found this video helpful Please Subscribe um yeah so good luck on all your Journeys I believe in you guys you guys got it I'll see you guys next time bye
v1veRGRvxQg,[Music] this will be the Year this again what every year you do the same thing and you always fail oh okay this year is going to be different trust this will be the [Music] year man I'm dropping out you will succeed this year you will succeed this year year you will succeed this year succeed you will suceed what is this can you turn off the lights I'm trying to trying to manifest here you will succeed you will suce this will be the year just stop Nick I know you're not going to do this but I guess at least you don't have a bunch of rocks like last year yeah those rocks were so weird weren't they anyways what do I do teach am I just doomed to fail well not exactly what you need to do is watch this hey guys I hope you guys are doing fantastic big thanks to my teacher for doing that skit with me he's a real one for real anyways don't worry you guys are not doomed even if the last couple of years haven't gone the way you wanted it to it's just because you didn't have the game plan set whether it's getting high grades a jack physique or just fulfilling any of the goals you had in today's video I'll be showing you the full guide on how to lock in this school year year so let's do it the first step in making this year your best year is to have a list of goals set goals periodically 3 months from now 6 months from now 9 months from now and eventually 1 year from now this will help you stay focused and give you a reality check every 3 months saying are you locked in homie okay think about it like this if you run towards your goal without a plan or clear steps you might take a longer route face detours or end up far away from your destination but with the map you won't get lost and can stay on the path that leads you directly to your goals so having a game plan a little map of goals needed to make up a bigger goal is extremely important next I want you to start planning out your week okay okay I know what you're thinking Nick that takes way too much work but it really doesn't it takes like 10 minutes of your day and it's super super helpful this pretty much takes the goal planning idea to a Next Level having a schedule of what you want to do every day just makes you a lot more likely to actually do it and it makes you a lot more productive here's an example of what my week looks like and how I follow it it's time to go study I guess it's time to eat okay so maybe it didn't look that fun but trust me it's a lot better and a lot more helpful than it seems anyways you don't have to follow it exactly it's just a guideline to show you how much time you have in your day which is another point I want to bring up a lot of my friends come up to me and be like hey Nick I want to start a business hey Nick I want to get jacked hey Nick I want to get a perfect score on my SAT and when I say why don't you do it they say I don't have enough time you have enough time homie take a good look at your screen time and that's how much free time you have have and I know this is going to be an argument in the comments like I'm sure there's people saying oh I have a job just stay up a little later the world doesn't care about your situation so just try to make the best if you have to sacrifice a couple hours of sleep for this time period then do it as long as you're still trying to be like healthy it it'll all work out trust me but don't worry I understand the job life I worked at Chick-fil-A while I was in school trying to achieve all these good things and yeah it wasn't fun but you make it out you make it out trust also I'm not trying to criticize anyone I'm trying to be the best version of myself and I'm trying to help you guys be the best version of yourself so yeah I mean we got this kings and queens small demographic of my audience but we we all got it we yes yes anyways another key to being consistent is by making things effortless which leads me to today's sponsor updf okay hold up I actually use these guys and I think they're really cool so listen up updf is like having your own personalized assistant for all your school work imagine all your notes assignments and study material all perfectly organized ready

can use you PDF on four devices and you get a bunch of iCloud data so your data is all safe and secure also right now there's exclusive discount for updf pro just look in the link in my description and yeah check out the link below I think you'll love it so anyways let's go back to the video next I want to talk about consistency habits shout out to my boy James Clear in his book Atomic habits you should definitely give it a read anyways making studying a part of your daily routine is super super important the more you do something consistently the more it becomes a habit and the easier it is to do it might be hard for the first week or two but after that you'll be set it will just be a habit that you do every day quick side note this is my friend John now you might be thinking why is he showing us John is he some type of productivity savior or study genius well no but he's just as important he is my study partner having a study partner can make studying 10 times easier when you have two people who are just consistent and want to go study it's so easy it's so free you just you just like head to a cafe or something so yeah get one okay let's continue another tip for making this year your best year is by hitting the gym okay so I know this might seem completely unrelated to school and no this is not just a rant from a gym rat trying to spread gym culture but I genuinely believe that the gym has helped me so much and can help you so much it builds skills like dedication consistency confidence and big pectoral muscles which is all key in achieving everything that you want in life especially the big pectoral muscles it might seem hard to fit in the gym with your busy schedule with your academics and extracurriculars but please try to do it the gym has some really really incredible benefits besides the obvious which is just being healthy nothing has made me realize more that I can accomplish a goal than the gym the gym is like this shining Beacon of light that says hey you can do it I mean just look at these big muscles I built this confidence leads you to be happier which leads you to put yourself out there for more opportunities this can lead to more friends new connections and just more respect from your peers the gym also just changes your mindset it teaches you delayed gratification and it's just overall immensely important for achieving your goals this school year so hit the gym folks okay finally we have my last and most important tip can I get a drum roll please it's hating being unproductive I know it sounds like amazing advice right I know that advice seems a little wonky but let me explain I'm at the point where even looking at Tik Tok just makes me feel a little bit disgusted it's because when I scroll on Tik Tok I know I could be grinding fulfilling my life purpose or actually getting real dopamine from my friends instead of this Doom scrolling device named Bob yeah I Nam my phone Bob but that's besides the point the point is I find happiness from being productive and find no happiness from being unproductive start feeling bad about myself if I'm unproductive also let me clarify being productive doesn't mean you can't hang out with your friends or have free time I personally believe that being productive means you have time for friends and have time for free time it's just as long as you got your work done first okay now that we got that out of the way let's talk about how we can actually use this for our application every time you go to the gym go study or do something productive I want you to think to yourself wow I'm awesome I am doing something amazing I am getting my life together go me okay so this might sound weird but self-affirmation goes a a long way a lot more than you think and when you're doing something unproductive like scrolling through Tik Tok I want you to think is this adding value to my life why am I doing this and could I be dedicating this time to something more important to me and I want you to really feel these words I genuinely hate being unproductive so much that it genuinely makes me feel horrible being unproductive you could call it gaslighting but I call it beneficial gaslighting I think that makes it a lot better it maybe who cares just please don't get too carried away and actually start self-hating yourself we're all human we all make mistakes we all can't be productive 24/7 right so make sure that you're just trying to be 1% better every day and if you have setbacks you have setbacks all right you got this trust me I know you can do it it's all about being 1% better every day you got this kings and queens okay so honestly that kind of just wraps up everything you need to lock in for this school year just be consistent with positive habits go to the gym like being productive and dislike Bob and you'll be set good luck with any Ventures you have this year and if it means anything I believe in you I believe you can do it so oh one other thing my content has been circling around everywhere recently from training like Jake Paul to best investments for teenagers I've gone like pretty far apart please let me know what you guys want to see next either if it's a challenge video advice video or Vlogs or just anything else just uh let me know okay thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys have a great day I'll see you later bye wow that video was great that guy is so handsome and he seems so intelligent that's just what I was thinking subscribe
phkoPq83ti4,hey guys my name is Nicholas burn and I've been Lifting for over 5 years now and in this video I want to help you avoid five big mistakes that could leave you with little to no gains stunted height and injuries that further limit your ability to get that dream body that you've always wanted and trust me I've made so many of these mistakes so I just want to help you avoid them and fast trck your progress and leave you with no regret when getting started in the gym okay let's get started the first problem I want to address is Eagle lifting and not using proper form especially if you're teen if you're eagle lifting and not working out properly this could lead to stunted growth because of injury to a growth plate you can also get long lasting damage and a big embarrassment for future you trust me I know it feels super good to lift heavy weights but if you're sacrificing range of motion and proper form it's not worth it here's me when I first started working out ready 130 lb you do it let's go as you can see I was ego lifting and only focusing on impressing my friends and myself but I had really really bad form and I didn't even go halfway down before pressing the weights up if I learned the proper form of bench press and didn't ego lift prior to this then I could have FASTT Tred my progress and also done this a lot safer also one thing if a workout or routine causes you pain don't do it just because it works for someone else doesn't mean it'll work for you and there's so many different workouts out there that you can just experiment and use so yeah if any workout is causing you pain don't do it please try to find a movement that is really comfortable for your body and extremely fun to do those are the best type of workouts the next problem is not taking progress photos taking progress photos might seem uncomfortable or embarrassing at first but these photos are really important to show you why you started and how much you've accomplished it's really easy to feel like you've made no progress especially if you're looking at your body every single day not noticing the changes and this can lead to less motivation and we don't want that we want you to be proud of what you accomplish and gain that self-confidence of changing I want you to have a photo where you can look back at and be proud of what you've accomplished there's really only upsides to taking progress photos so take them and you can also make like a super cool progress video and like post it on YouTube and get a lot of views so you know only Pros up next is picking a training split training splits is basically how you divide your workout throughout the weeks giving your muscles ample time to recover between sessions leading to more muscle growth a few popular workout splits you can choose from are the full body split which is basically training your full body in a session two to three times a week another one is the upper lower body split which divides your training into upper and lower body days usually performed 4 days out of the week a more intensive one is the Arnold split which is really nice and it's shown here and last my personal favorite is the push pull leg and I think it's also the most common workout routine which which basically divides your workout into three main categories Push Pull and legs push being chest shoulder and triceps pull being back and biceps and legs being legs and abs and for reference here is my personal pushpull leg routine next is not consuming enough protein protein is the building block of your muscles your body needs protein to grow repair and to work properly I cannot express how important it is to get protein it's as simple as if you don't get protein your muscles aren't going to grow back before when I was preparing for my powerlifting competition I was averaging around 80 g of protein per day and although this is perfectly fine I wasn't enough to see great results so for the following month I increased my protein intake by chugging 90 G protein shakes gagging and getting it down and although this is definitely not the best way to go at it my bench press went from 245 to 275 in just about a month and prior to taking these protein shakes my bench Prest was around 2 45 and it was plateaued and it was not increasing that just shows you how important protein is it's great for building muscle and it helps you recover way faster and again you probably shouldn't increase your protein intake by chugging 90 G protein shakes but by actually eating food that is high in protein like seafood chicken and steak I was just really desperate but protein shakes are definitely fine as long as you're consuming them in safe amounts like 30 to 50 g the general rule of protein is consuming 1 g of protein per pound of body weight and and this can differ between cutting and bulking if you're cutting increase the protein intake if you're bulking just keep it the same don't worry about it as much and lastly don't compare yourself to others genetics matter everyone moves at their own pace don't compare yourself to your friend who has been lifting the same amount of time as you but has better results that is just genetics but this doesn't mean you can't look great with bad genetics it just means it's going to take you a little longer to get the results that you want don't let yourself get down and just be consistent and put in the hard work and the results will follow also there is a lot of stigma of what is and what is not achievable with steroids in the last year or so I've been seeing a significant amount of people lower the bar on what they think is achievable natural some people can't believe that I'm natural even though I am yes I have great genetics but this was also the result of 5 years of consistent hard work a lot of people are using the phrase that's not achievable natural to justify their lack of effort or justify using steroids it's all about consistency and work don't focus on the results but focus on the journey have fun gain confidence and better yourself that's the whole point of the gym okay that's it for this video I hope you guys have a great day if you enjoyed this video please consider subscribing and yeah I'll see you guys later good luck on your gym Journey bye
t_mGvTXTFMU,ah meow diet hey guys so today we'll be talking about diet now I cannot express how important diets are and even a bad diet can lead to the loss of muscle tissue and with summertime coming up I'm sure a lot of you are trying to achieve that dream bod which I'm gonna help you with I know a lot of people watching my videos are teenagers and with being a teenager you're probably eating your parents diet now this might make it a little harder to lose or gain weight but you'll just have to work that little bit harder I know how difficult it can be especially in Asian culture where if you leave a single grain of rice you're probably smoked the truth is you really don't need a specific meal routine to get jacked or lose weight reshaking yourself to a diet of chicken and rice is not only bad for your mental health but also bad for your physical health and to be blunt I don't have a specific meal routine but I'm not sitting in my gluteus maximus watching this video Eating Dorito chips while in a blue shirt yes I am talking about you the fact is I know how to work with what I got and I'll show you how to work with what you got I'll show you all the steps to achieve your dream body but the first step in this is understanding calories losing and gaining weight is all dependent on calories calories in calories out if you want to start losing weight start cutting your calories and if you want to start gaining weight start putting on more calories you might be wondering how many calories you should be eating well let's start with the baselines average male consumes around 2 800 calories while the average female consumes about 1800 calories should you follow these skylines no I'm assuming if you came to this video you're probably trying not to be average and trying to look better and have a more aesthetic body now you might be thinking you should be able to eat the same amount of calories the average man since you're working out in the gym but you're probably overestimating how many calories you actually burn while lifting weights the average one hour workout sesh that's pretty hard and includes weight Burns around 150 to 350 calories weightlifting is totally different from cardio and you have to understand that weightlifting is for building muscle cardio is for burning calories so how many calories should you be eating well I can't really tell you because that's all up to you I would start tracking your calories see where you're at and if you're trying to lose weight just start cutting down on those calories and if you're trying to gain weight start adding some calories on there's a couple tips that make losing weight and gaining weight a lot easier eating low calorie or high calorie dense food low calorie dense food is really important because you can eat a lot of it without putting on too many calories which means you get more full without getting more fat that calorie dense foods makes it easier to get more calories while not being as full making you get a little more you know full some great options for low calorie dense foods are fruits and veggies fruits and veggies usually have a high water content making you fill up faster does this mean you can skip your veggies if you're trying to gain weight no but if it's too hard for you to gain weight while eating veggies then you can use a dietary supplement one that I like to use is human tonic which actually my uncle made used to be a triathlon athlete so he knows his stuff I definitely recommend trying it at least once you can get all the veggies and vitamins you need just from taking the supplement and the best thing is you don't actually have to eat it you can just put it in your drink and you're set it can also help with your mood so it's a win-win you can use my code nicholas10 to get 10 off your order and help support this channel some great high calorie dense foods are avocados and nuts nuts are so good these nuts having a scoop of nuts is great for your bulking up as it adds around 200 calories making it so much easier nuts I also like your nuts now let's talk about eating your parents food although it might be super delicious those calories can really add up I would say the first step in fixing this problem is telling your parents about your aspirations and maybe they'll support you or even join you in your workout Venture although if this doesn't work it's straight to skip and snack time and doing cardio cardio Burns so many calories if you do it right even going on a two mile walk can burn so many calories as long as you don't eat more after doing cardio you're set weight will start coming off super fast you got it after doing cardio unless you're trying to bulk up does this mean you can skip cardio if you're trying to bulk up no cardio is meant for everyone helps with the heart good for you do it just eat a little more you got that now this is for all my skinny Legends out there if you're already shredded and you just want to gain a little muscle I would add 300 to 500 calories to your diet preferably protein based to gain that muscle while looking lean and shredded a lot of you have been asking if I ever went on bulk after you saw my transformation video but no I never poked up I just ate a little Surplus to gain my muscle now I see a lot of people trying to lose or gain weight at a really fast rate now that's fine if you really want it that bad but losing weight or gaining weight at a slower rate is totally fine and is way healthier for you I know there's a lot of pressure on teenagers especially at this time to get jacked or look shredded and I know I'm 100 part of that problem but there's no rush one step at a time protein protein is probably the most important nutrient for building muscle your body needs protein to grow to repair its cells and to work properly I cannot express how important protein is back when I Was preparing for a natural state bench press competition I up my protein intake by drinking 90 gram protein shakes every day while gagging and although this is definitely not the way to go my bench press went from 245 to 275 in just about a month definitely don't expect these results though because that was due to my genetics and a new training regimen which I'll be dropping a video about soon which got me all of that but this should 100 prove how important protein intake is now let's talk about body fat percentage what body fat should you aim to be to look aesthetic I would say to look aesthetic your body fat should probably be around 8 to 12 percent and depending on your genetics this will definitely affect your comfort level if it's too stressful or hard on you to maintain that aesthetic level then there's no shame in going up some body fat as long as you're feeling better and healthier that's all that really matters if you have any questions you can always reach me out on my Instagram DMS and I'll be trying to answer any questions related to Fitness have a great day bye-bye
2jBdlESVxFM,hey you look big what's your max bench what's your max bench what's your max bench every time even with benching every workout I get nowhere the gym Bros of this world are too cruel it's just a lift bro it's not just a lift the bench press it's the staple of a gym bro it's one of the three iconic lifts and if I must say it's the best lift achieving a 225 bench is like achieving [Music] [Applause] [Music] manhood holy but how do you increase your Bene press well today I'll show you today we'll be talking about how to rapidly increase your bench [Music] press hi my name is Nicholas SP and at 16 at 15 lb body weight I bench 315 I also set the a single bench world record for my agent weight class so you know I know a lot about bench press and today I'll be showing you how to rapidly increase your bench press through five parts form training techniques frequency supporting muscle groups and nutrition that will all help maximize your bench press okay so first we're going to be talking about form so if you're already comfortable with your form you can skip to this time frame but I think it would be good for any lifter to like just review the basics and make sure they're doing everything right and not doing anything wrong so uh yeah okay so proper form is definitely crucial for increasing your bench press but is also crucial for reducing injury I've got so many injuries over the years with bench press so I know you definitely want to avoid this so yeah I'm just going to show you all the proper techniques so you don't get injured and you maximize that bench okay so for your body position position you want to maintain a stable Arch back and you do this by retracting your shoulder blades and putting them down this really helps with any pain or tension in your shoulder and if you still feel any pain or tension in your shoulder you definitely want to check that out you know and make sure that you are retracting your shoulder blades and putting them down you also want to keep your feet planted on the ground and push forward just a tiny bit so you do have the tension throughout your legs and also you want to brace your core with that archb so you have tension throughout the whole body so you're more like a slingshot you know okay we're going to move on to hand placement and for this the general rule is to have it a little wider than shoulder width but how I like to do it is put the bar on my chest and find a point where my forearms are perpendicular to my bicep making a 90° angle this really helps with the wrists and make sure that your wrist doesn't get injured and also helps you maximize the amount of force you're going to put in but again you do want to experiment to see which position feels the most comfortable for you so yeah okay okay moving on we're going to put our eyes right below the bar and in some cases when I don't have a spotter or have someone to lift off I like to put the bar right below my lips just because it feels a little more comfortable for me but after you lift the bar up you want to lower it to your lower chest and while you're here you do want to make sure that you're feeling all the tension and when you push up you don't want to push up vertically you want to push up more in an arc or more of a curve and this really helps with the amount of power you can really put out and it feels more comfortable for your body reducing injury so yeah you want to push out into an art so the general rule is when you lift it you want to go over your shoulders so lower chest to shoulders lower chest to shoulders oh yeah and I also like to lower the bar more controlled and then spring up faster this just helps me control the weight and makes me feel better and more comfortable yeah so just that's like the general form but remember everyone is built a little differently so definitely work on how your body feels and what makes you feel the most comfortable and what makes you feel the strongest okay let's get into training routines and frequency when increasing my bench press I really wanted to bench around three to four times a week four might seem really excessive but I was going for the world record bench so I had to increase my frequency I would probably do four times a week rest then three times a week rest four times a week so I'd re repeat the cycle right but this is really to increase it for the powerlifting meet for a lot of you guys you just want to increase your bench press not professionally not on a competitive level so I would still say two to three times a week would be best for optimizing bench press and that's definitely something you can put in your routine definitely if you want you can follow the pushpull leg routine to still do two times a week and you'll still increase your bench press up by a ton but yeah just letting you know if you do want to increase your bench press the more you do it it's usually better you still want to have rest days right so when I did bench press for four times a week I wouldn't go heavy on all of them I would go probably heavy on two to three of them and have the rest for like form and just activation muscle to really get the Mind muscle connection there is a point where I would be in class right and I'll be writing papers or something and I would be activating my chest muscles while writing my essay so it's just I did the frequency to get more of the Mind muscle connection than anything because rest you still want your rest that's super important but yeah okay so for the most of you guys though I probably be three times a week and this is how I would structure that in your routine okay so for the first day of benching throughout the week I would do more of a hypertrophy day where I would pause bench maybe 8 to 10 Reps for around four sets going down each weight like a pyramid style training and this really helps my muscle growth and also like it's more of a slow and controlled type of process getting a lot more reps done and then I would transition this into day two where it's more of a power day where I'll go heavy so I'll do probably three to five reps paus still slow and controlled but definitely a lot heavier this day cuz I do want to work my strength so paused up and I would probably do this around for four reps again decreasing the weight accordingly like a pyramid style training and finally for the last day day three I would do more explosive type training where I'll do maybe 5 to eight reps and I'll go pretty explosive this would really help my fast twitch muscle fibers grow and you know it it's more fun as well and by repeating the cycle it really helps your bench press go up so I do want to go more in depth with pause benching that I was mentioning and it's basically where you do a regular bench press but you pause it at the bottom of your chest for around 1 to 2 seconds then go up this really makes it where you have no momentum to really slingshot it with your chest and this really isolates your chest to another level and you get Hella gains from this like actually your bench will go up so much I've had a friend who came to me is like hey I'm in a plateau what do I do my bench is not going up and I told him about the pause benching and just in a couple weeks this bench was going up 10 lb every every time he worked out it was crazy that's just the power of pause benching and there's definitely other techniques and routines that you can incorporate it's just I personally love pause benching and I do it two out of the three times at workout bench press a week okay now let's talk about the supporting muscle groups mainly the triceps and shoulders if you ever had an experience where the bench press was very easy at the beginning of the port but very hard to lock out that is because your triceps are lacking and this is a case with a lot of people I've definitely seen a lot of people get all the way to the middle of the bench press and just fail because their triceps could not lock out so how do we solve this I love to do tricep push Downs or just close grip bench press that really helps explode those triceps and get them used to the movement of going up because your triceps do play a huge role in bench press there was like a time where I wasn't even hitting triceps because my bench press was doing it for me so I mean and that just really emphasizes how much your triceps matter in the bench press now the shoulders are also very important for stabilizing your bench press and just making it feel a lot better also your back is engaging with the bench press especially what I told you with the lats like how it's more like a throw like you know so you do want to work on those muscle groups and just doing stuff like shoulder press or lateral raises will definitely increase the stability of your bench press that will definitely make it go up this also applies to you if it's really easy to lock out but it's very hard to get to the beginning section of the bench press and that's when techniques like the Paw Bend sure isolating on the chest really helps sort out that problem and this is also super good to getting you out of plateaus it's definitely a period where I had a plateau for like 6 months my bench trust is not going up and I started working on my triceps more and I did work on my shoulders more and this definitely helped my bench press go up okay and the last part is nutrition and I know a lot of you guys are lacking on this you might be doing everything right but if you don't have the right proteins to really build back your muscle your bench press is not going to grow at a fast rate right so what we really want to do is prioritize protein intake like protein is super important for building your muscles and helping you increase your bench press it also reduces recovery time it's just overall amazing and if you guys think you are eating enough protein maybe you aren't if you aren't seeing a significant growth in your bench press protein might be it so I like to structure my protein as probably 1 G per pound of body weight so I'm 155 lb I would probably take 155 g of protein or a little bit more right just making sure I have enough protein to really fuel the chest and especially if you're bench pressing three to four times a week you definitely need your recovery to be faster which again relates to the protein intake so yeah definitely emphasize your protein intake that it's going be very important you also want to be in a slight calorie Surplus I mean that's just going to help you grow muscle faster and just help your bench press go up so yeah so for nutrition it's just calorie Surplus and more protein follow the training routines the techniques and boom your brch press will go up and I promise to you guys with nutrition it's very important there's been times where I worked out the same but I just had like an extra 60 gr protein shake and my brch press would go crazy amounts like I remember my bench was at 255 pounds and I wasn't really focusing on the nutrition as soon as I started hopping on those like 60 G protein shakes my bench started going up 10 lb per week which sounds like freaking insane but I was really lacking on protein especially my mom is vegetarian you don't really get a lot of protein in there so I definitely did start taking it into my own hands and started having more protein more protein shakes and boom boom boom my bench press started skyrocketing again and if you even if you do follow all of these routines the nutrition the techniques and like the frequency it's not a guarantee that your bench press will go up as fast as others genetics play a huge role in bench pressing and that's just something you got to accept for me I have great genetics my bench press can go up anytime I really want it to you know I also have shorter wingspan so the Met tress is kind of built for me and that's why my bench PR is pretty high so don't be sad when your you and your friends they bench the same amount we do the same things but they have a higher bench it's just going to be genetics but that does not mean you cannot have a 315 bench like go on you got that I think anyone no matter how long it takes can get a 315 bench or just get a pretty high very respectable bench press you just have to work on it you have to have the consistency you have to have the frequency you have to have the training routines you have to have the nutrition locked down down and your bench press will go up and this is not just for bench press this is for everything else like your genetics do play important role but come on you can build a great body without having great genetics and it might be hypocritical to say that because I do have good genetics but that's just the truth I've had some friends that take a really long time to build muscle but when they do they look fantastic and you just got to remember that you got it king or queen cuz you're better [Music] oh yeah okay all joking is hide that's pretty much all you need for bench Prest if you already knew this my bad but yeah I'm just going to do a short recap of like the most important things I think the most important thing is the pause PCH like to be honest that has helped my bench grow up so much and especially if you're a plateau and you're not using pause PCH yet use ppch also I say the second most important thing is the protein intake like if you not have enough Pro scene your body is just not going to be able to recover so yeah get those two locked down and your bench will go up this is definitely helped a lot of my friends so hopefully it can help you in the same way and yeah I'll see you guys later oh also more uploads are coming soon I've been really busy with finals and sat so I've been cramming it all in but I am on winter break now so expect a lot more videos and I do want to be posting a lot more but yeah okay bye guys
2sSo0yMnLeg,hi I'm Nick I've been lifting since the ages home and over the past four years I developed a body that I am proud of but how has this transformation affected my body and my happiness does lifting young give you that popularity and attention that many teens here for or does it throw a Young Generation into a spiral body dysmorphia stuntingly growth in ruining their body image to understand my perspective let's start at the very beginning of my journey as a kid I was considered pretty skinny and definitely did not have a lot of muscle I grew up watching anime particularly in the genre of Shonen which included animes like Naruto fairy tale and Sword Art Online which was a huge inspiration seeing the protagonist being buff and strong I was like God damn I need to get like that so I guess you could say anime was kind of one of the Sparks that started my workout journey I eventually got a home gym which I would work on my body maybe six or seven times per week which gave me my good body but also addiction to posing in every mirror I found over these years I built a great experience in the gym and I just want to share with you I want to share all the pros and cons and if you should start lifting as a teenager Pro number one confidence with a good body your self-image really improves and with more self-confidence life seems and gets a lot more fun once you feel comfortable in your body either through realizing that you're big or realizing what you've accomplished your happiness can start really going up I'm at the point where I feel 100 comfortable in my body and I love to show it off and that social anxiety that you get from not looking good or feeling that you're not good enough can start going away I mean this won't all happen because you have a good body but it's definitely a catalyst that can start changing things having pride in yourself and knowing what you can accomplish really sets the bar for yourself confidence to go up if you're sitting in the mirror right now and you look at yourself and you're not happy with what you have achieved then working out to get a better body will definitely make you feel better about yourself so if you're struggling with your body right now and struggling with your confidence pick up some weights and start going to the gym trust me it helps so much and it makes life so much more fun it's really a shame to live your life in a body that you aren't comfortable with Pro number two life skills what I mean by this is by working out you're able to hold yourself accountable for your body and your life in this sense of being in charge it's really important for teenagers because that's one of the first times you can be fully independent it really ships your mentality to why did this happen to me why is life so hard to how can I improve my life how can I be better we can also think about working out like this if you can work out consistently for years you can work on your future consistently for years these skills that you learn and the hard work that you put in all translate to life as you guys know I started lifting at the age of 12 and over the past years I have developed Fiverr business I have made my own website started thinking about future businesses and recently in the past couple months I finally made that final step to design manufacture and mass-produce my own business the name is Q Futures and it's coming out in two months stay tuned and I think it's because I started working out at such a young age where I can find it easy to sit down and just work on my future the gym is definitely a stepping stone for all your life goals the ambition and drive that you build up just by going to the gym is absolutely crazy and insane and yeah you also just respect yourself enough to not go back on your wishes if you are dieting and trying to cut down and you do that successfully then you definitely have enough respect to yourself to fulfill your wishes your body rests in your hands and you bear that responsibility how you treat your body will definitely show Pro number three Health now I know this might seem obvious but you really gotta take care of your health both physically and mentally being Physically Active is really important because it can help increase your brain activity lower your chances of getting diseases and help you manage your weight and in recent studies scientists have found that your muscles can be compared to an endocrine organ where it releases chemicals hormones and proteins that are all super beneficial to your brain health these chemicals can make you resilient to stress and act as a natural antidepressant the idea that your muscles are basically antidepressant and all you have to do to get them is to contract your muscles or just be physically active is so cool so if you're in some turmoil or you've got some trauma in here maybe working out would help you definitely if you're like over a breakup too oh my goodness working out helps so much so not just for your physical health but also your mental health you probably should start going to the gym now let's talk about the cons and one of the most asked questions in lifting as a teen stunt your growth well to answer the question of can lifting young stun your growth the answer is it can but very rarely the only way it can is through accidents or bad form that hurt your growth plates you shouldn't be scared though because this can happen into every sport as long as you're not ego lifting or doing anything stupid you're totally fine and in my opinion I actually think that lifting young builds great habits that make you grow taller habits like sleeping early or managing your diet can really help with growth the only con no one really talks about this daily harassment the unconsented touching it happens to me almost every day booty grabbing booby flicking AB hunching what am I supposed to do okay in all seriousness working out is great and if you're a teen I would highly suggest that you start working out to build those good habits if you enjoyed this video please consider liking and subscribing and you can hit me on my Instagram if you have any questions and I'll be trying to answer them thank you so much for watching bye bye foreign
REK97mCOojY,[Music] I spent 30 days without my [Music] phone but why the average American spends around 5 hours a day on their phone and for me I was spending 6 and 1/2 hours mindlessly scrolling my phone and it's so normalized that this doesn't even seem crazy so I did some calculations and excluding My Essentials like sleeping eating using the restroom personal hygiene and commuting I only had 11 hours of 30 minutes of free time and I was spending 56% of this free time on my phone and that's when I knew I had to change something up why would I waste half my life on a phone especially when I know there's so many better things to do hey guys so it's day one and I think I'm fully realizing what no phone means for 30 days damn I think this is going to be a little harder than I thought actually I was in the shower I was like what am I going to do without my phone for 30 days like the feeling of being left out and stuff like that oh my gosh I'm going to get started with my day about to go to school and the plan is just to do the plan hey guys so I just finished day one of this Challenge and I'm feeling pretty good like having no phone is not that bad I mean I did feel lonely especially when I wanted to go Cafe and study and I was like who going to text like I have WhatsApp but who has WhatsApp you know day one was finished and I was doing pretty all right and things would just keep progressing hey guys so it is day three of the no phone and like kind of productivity challenge so uh yeah I mean it's going pretty well I do feel happier I feel more content with my life I don't feel as overwhelmed and it's only day three and I just picked up um I don't know if you guys can see no bad parts is a book that I'm reading it's more like a kind of like a therapy type book but it's helping me find myself and it's really good like honestly the book might sound a little weird when you first get it but I definitely recommend the book I'm not finished with it yet but damn it's pretty good so yeah overall life is looking pretty good the phone thing is not a challenge right now especially since I'm going to school for like 8 hours of the day then I'm going to study for like the next four so I don't really have time to be on my phone anyways but when December break hits which is going to be in like a week then I think that's when the challenge is actually going to start this sense of Happiness would continue throughout the week and it made the so-called hard things easy hey guys so it's officially week one of the no phone like productivity Challenge and it's it's going really good actually like I've been really locked in recently which is super good because I have finals this week and it's actually tomorrow on Thursday I've been spending at least 5 hours after school just studying for them getting them out the way reading books and that's something I don't think I would have done with my phone on without the distraction I'm doing a lot better I feel a lot more focused I do feel a little bit more bored but I have more time to myself and I think that's really crucial in finding myself finding my inner happiness stuff like that I kind of feel like a philosopher it's only been one week so um yeah I mean everything's going really well I feel like I don't even need a phone at this point like if I get a Macbook then I can just text people on that and I I don't think I need a phone so I mean yeah it's going really well sitting down and editing was getting fun and all those so-called hard things were getting more enjoyable I could focus more and I could lock in more effortlessly and this led me to achieve a lot more of my goals and I'm pretty sure this is all due to the absence of dopamine from my phone a lot of people refer to dopamine as a feel-good chemical but it's also the motivator of your brain when you get a notification on your phone you get a little rush of dopamine and then it leads you to have the motivation to click that notification and with our phone we get a lot of super nor normal stimuli that our brains which have not developed for a thousand years aren't used to so we get overwhelmed by all of this dopamine or this super normal stimuli and eventually we just get used to it and with this absence of my phone or super normal stimuli my Baseline of enjoyment was just higher everything that was not as rewarding as scrolling through Instagram before became just as rewarding we can think about it like this imagine a drug addict every time he takes a drug he gets this huge rush of dopamine which makes him repeat this action ignoring the consequences and after some time if he gets clean he starts to find life a lot more enjoyable because he doesn't have this huge cloud of that dopamine Rush that he was getting before so his Baseline of life just becomes a lot more enjoyable he can start finding the motivation to actually start doing things and in these 30 days I was really feeling the absence of this drug of supernormal stimuli and my Baseline enjoyment for doing work was just a lot higher I actually look forward to doing my editing I was like I'm going to finish this I'm going to feel good this going to be my rush for the day this is good and it that's something I definitely did not feel like when I had my phone I could scroll on Tik talk for hours right or go on Instagram for hours and everything else just seemed hard or like I wouldn't be able to do it cuz my attention span wasn't long enough and I just felt tired every time I opened a math notebook or something and without this overlapping huge amount of supernormal stimuli everything just seems a lot better hey guys so it's day 20 of the challenge and I just want to update you with a couple things that have been happening so I feel like my happiness levels have really gone up and such a dramatic way like I think maybe a day ago I was going to a cafe and I wanted to go there to eat lunch and watch a new episode of jjk Jutsu kaisen I don't know if you guys are on track with that one but I went to the cafe and there was this corner spot that I really like and it was open right so I got to sit in that corner Spot while eating my lunch while watching juu Kaizen and I was so happy like seeing that open spot in the corner made me like keep smiling and it really made my day it was so weird I was never I've never been so happy about just like a freaking Corner in a cafe like a small things like that really have been taking place and making me very happy I've even started to enjoy food more it's it's so weird like how not having your phone can like increase your food taste I don't know but I've been like enjoying more of the flavors recently cuz I don't have my phone to look at while I eat I'm starting to evaluate each flavor of the food that I'm eating and that just brings it to a whole another level of enjoyment and it's so weird that I'm just I'm just having a lot more fun a lot more enjoyable moments even like editing which used to be so hard is now fun I'm on my computer I'm like oh my gosh I'm doing so good like this is so good this is going to be a banger I know people are going to like this video so it's a really nice change of pace and yeah it's just life is a lot more enjoyable right now so yeah I mean hopefully this continues even when I get my phone back right okay yeah uh I'll see you guys in the next update and the day finally came day 30 where I got my phone back hey guys it is day 30 let's go I get my phone back and also yesterday was my last day of December break so I have to go to school now so I don't have a lot of time to speak cuz I'm actually running a little late but we're going to go get my phone and then after school I'll give you a full update on everything but yeah okay let's go get that phone don't it's a little messy in here but don't mind that there we [Music] go I'm going to head back inside it's it's pretty cold phone is back in possession um yeah that's pretty cool I need to head of school I'm going to be late this is the first day going back to school so oh the lights turned off oh okay well I'll see you guys later hey guys so I got off of school I was editing some videos and now we're here day 30 I have my phone and it's okay actually I was going to school I left it in the car cuz I'm just not used to bring my phone anymore so hopefully I don't leave it anywhere that's going to be a big concern but I'll just do a whole conclusion and a recap of how I was feeling in these 30 days I think it was a phenomenal experience and I would say it's kind of life-changing when you were getting this huge amount of supern normal stimuli from your phone and and you're spending for me at least I was spending 6 and 1/2 hours with this super normal stimuli that really messes with your brain and it makes it a lot harder to do the things you actually want to do so for anyone who is in a rut anyone who feels like man why can't I do the work I know I have to do why am I so lazy and just all of these things I would 100% recommend doing a phone detox just like I did or maybe start deleting social media I think definitely getting off your phone is a great Habit to have and I'm going to continue using this in my own life when I do work my phone is 100% going into a different room if I'm going to school it's probably going to stay in the car so I could concentrate on what matters and I'm just going to use it a whole lot less one thing I do miss though is music in the gym my gym workouts were terrible I I just did not have like the motivation push as hard as I did with music and I think that's pretty much it that's the only con I had with this challenge is not having music in the gym right like everything has just gone up my happiness my abilities my mindset like my channel has even grown since I've done this no phone thing cuz I can actually put time into what I want to do and I actually enjoy what I want to do and I just want to also talk about my creativity has gone up so much my imagination like before it was hard to map up what I was going to do for a video or it was hard to think of a script but now ideas just flow into my head I can have a clear image of what I'm going to do for the intro what I'm going to write for my script for my YouTube videos what I'm going to name it and this just is crazy I mean there's just so many benefits to not using your phone like for instance even in the car I had no music so I would practice my public speaking or I would maybe try to sing right and you could actually build on this like my public speaking has got a lot better I can get more words more concise I can have a better flow with words by practicing I don't know I mean overall it was just an amazing experience 100% it is a little inconvenient though just in case you want to try it but if you have like a Macbook then you're set like you don't need anything like a Macbook you have iMessages right you'll be fine so yeah I mean definitely this was a great experience great for my mind and I'm going to try to continue this momentum that I've built with having no phone with the rest of my life this definitely makes me think and I want you to think this as well how much supern normal stimuli do you want in your life right whether that be playing video games all night or goinging through social media all day just determine how much of this super normal stimuli you want because it does really affect your drive and motivation if you always have this super normal stimuli with you where are you going to get the motivation to do the hard things that you want to do so I'm just going to put that out there I loved it I mean I 100% recommend you try this if you want to especially if you're feeling like you've been lazy that you don't you can't do the hard things in life and stuff like that this really helped and I'm really glad I did this challenge I'll see you guys in the next video also my winter break is officially over just like we said so videos hopefully aren't going to be slower I'm going to still try to get them out once every week or two but I I'm going to be on the content grind this year so don't worry more videos are going to be coming so yeah I expect to see a lot more of me hopefully that's good um yeah so I'll see you guys next time then bye
AjPytTHoDJg,"for the next seven days I'll be training like Bruce Lee the most renowned martial artist of his time and when I say train like Bruce Lee I really mean it with the martial arts master who was taught by a direct student of Bruce Lee I'll be going through the hardest seven days of my life than you did and if for any reason I decide to quit the training I would have to fight the master [Music] himself be w my friend okay so what's the game plan for today first we're going to meet the master second we're going to hopefully survive the training and third we're going to head back home and probably train some more so let's get going hey Mr Marvin this is Mr Marvin trained by a student of Bruce Lee he has over 50 years of martial arts experience are you ready for the hardest seven days of your life and then there's me your average bodybuilder who neglects cardio yep after a quick discussion it was time to move on to my BAS test Bruce Lee was known for two finger push-ups with one hand and then the dragon fock do you think you can do that yeah probably I I think we started with a five finger push-up then moves on to three fingers and eventually two fingers on my knees yeah like that that's right that's good that's for you if you want to be like Bruce you got to do that only with one hand after realizing this is going to be a lot harder than I thought it was time for Bruce's iconic dragonfly dragonfly here we go that's the idea that's the that's that's the idea they go all the way down yeah that's next it was time to train Bruce Lee will start his workout off with a morning Run and Jump Rope so go you got to push you got to push you got to push got to push got to push just for clarification I do not do cardio and I was already dying and this was just the warmup so you want to try to look at the clock we're going to try to jump with 3 minutes that'll be equivalent to one ramp 3 minutes yeah this was going to be the longest 3 minutes of my life oh come on go go go go go go what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing come on go come on go good job good job good job good job I'm so glad the trading's done it's not done yet part eight this how you started his dat finally it was martial arts time so look your extension that pull back and while this looked fun I was going through some of the most intense training I've been through make you good I was in fact not good Alexa stop Bruce would wake up around 6:00 or 7: a.m. and start off with stretching Bruce Lee would then meditate to really calm his mind after a few minutes I felt like I reached Enlightenment sometimes when life gets really really hard you just have to step back and get harder my friend anyways today we are going to to be doing Bruce Lee's exact bodybuilding routine that he did three times per week so yeah let's get going okay so Bruce Lee did squats for his first workout it's 95 lbs for three sets of 10 reps yeah I mean let's let's get to it I'm put on 95 and um Bruce Lee is about to see what's up come on Bruce Lee Bruce Lee implemented bodybuilding exercises after a fight with racist Chinese martial artist named Wong Jackman where Bruce was defending his right to teach non-chinese Bruce would WI in this fight but realized he needed more conditioning and that's where he found bodybuilding something that would give him an edge over other martial artists on day three I was looking at Bruce Lee's dictionary to find the word rest days but to no avail I couldn't find it Bruce Lee didn't have rest days on his dictionary so what I'm going to do right now is a 1-hour bike ride following that up with 500 finger push-ups and then doing the sidekick 100 times because Bruce Lee said he's not scared of someone who does 10,000 kicks but does one kick 10,000 times but I'm not Bruce Lee so I'm just going to do 100 and then I'm probably going to do more after that so let's get going but under the sky under the heaven man there is but one family it's just so happen man that people are different I said empty your mind be formless shapeless hey guys so we have quite a problem my body is so sore it hurts to move and I have to go to Mr Marvin's class you know last time I barely survived and now I am completely sore my full body is just aching and I have to go go through that again well let's go Mr Marvin started the work out with some Tire flips then I did Tire smashes with a sledgehammer and followed that up with crock walks you made I then did some frog jumps and by the end of it I definitely felt like a frog I proceeded to do some warm-ups after that I couldn't tell you what I was doing here but it was definitely exhausting and if you thought those were bad try stretching it hurts like a [ __ ] and by the end of the training I was dead later that day I researched how Bruce Lee managed to recover after such intense training which led me to stumble across orgon meat okay so right here we have pork liver and pork keny kanji and then here we have large intestine pork okay let's start off with the pork liver kidney Kani and it looks good now I couldn't tell you if that was the pork liver or pork kidney but it's very very soft it's so tender I would just think this is like really soft chicken okay let's try the the pork contestant now man this this is the one I'm not looking forward to oh my God that took like 10 years to chew what the heck okay taste wise tastes amazing texture-wise oh no man that has a aftertaste what oh oh my God I don't know if that was the kidney or the liver but that was a very intense like oh my gosh taste after I

gell gun longell after showing off my wing Chong it was time to try Bruce's iconic sidekick now I would like for you to demonstrate an extension sidekick but first let's do it [Music] that's what you

THeGDSndBpo,in this video I'll be trying the world's most productive routine this routine is a combination of the three most well-known productivity Pros Andrew hberman a neuroscience and professor at Stanford University David gogins a Navy SEAL ultramarathon Runner and a motivational speaker and lastly Jordan Peterson a clinical psychologist a cultural critic and professor in Psychology through researching all of the daily habits and routines I've come up with the world's most productive routine and today we're going to do it so yeah let's get into it [Music] Alexa Alexa stop good morning guys it is currently it's 5:00 a.m. and yeah and you might be wondering did I just wake up with the beanie on no but my hair looks like Goku when I wake up so yeah and also we're about to go on a run so I'm I'm prepared for the cold weather outside all right uh but before that we have to start off our day with two cups of water so two cups of water going down the hatch done so do you guys rock with the fit I got like a gym shark under and then I got a breed vinity jacket outer so I think it looks pretty cool so we're going to be running in style today oh also quick note we had use my phone until we do this run because David goggin said as soon as we go to our phone that's like impurities and cancer coming in so we we got to say nah until we finish our run and we have armor whatever that's supposed to be so I'm running with that music it's going to be all mental oh my gosh let's go got to give my dog a little belly rub okay so we have a 45 minute run um it's currently 42° outside so it's a little cold yeah we're we're we're just going to go let's do [Music] this okay guys so we're at minute 20 and I'm really exhausted daveid gogin does minimum 12 miles every morning but I am not him so we're just running as far as we can in 45 minutes and I'm already dying I had this like one moment of like running high but that lasted for 5 seconds and then I started feeling like  again so yeah let's keep going done that was definitely not how I wanted to start off my morning but yeah I'm happy that I did it okay guys so it is um 6:00 a.m. so we are going to hop into a cold shower get ready for the day do some yoga n then go eat breakfast so yeah let let's go okay guys so um let's see that running PP if that's even a thing Post running this is the Strat you know just go on a go on a 45 minute run you look insane oh my gosh okay I'm actually looking forward to that whole shower hopefully it will wake me up because I'm still so sleepy it's really cold I'll see you at the end okay so I heard a lot of you complain that I don't show off my legs so you're wondering like if I even have legs but um today I'll show you today will be the day that I show you okay guys so I do have legs I just don't really show them off much because um cuz I'm always in underwear and lowkey feels weird just stripping down my pants in a gym but yeah okay I don't think my legs are terrible so there you go okay guys so it is officially 6:21 um we're about to do yoga NRA that's just something Mr huberman likes to do um he says like a 30 minute Yoga Nidra equates to like 5 to 6 hours of sleep for him like it feels like 5 to 6 hours of sleep so we're going to be doing 15 minutes today so yeah let's let's get going this is Ally and this is a rapid okay take a moment to notice how you feel here at the beginning of this practice into the [Music] nose out through the mouth such a powerful tool it's a zero cost tool that has enormous effects on not just accessing sleep and calm but enhancing rates of neuroplasticity okay um yeah actually that was kind of cool like I see why Andrew huberman does yoga nro definitely works I do feel a little more vested I wouldn't say like a huge amount more but I feel like I'm ready to start my day off going from the run to the cold shower everything was just like boom boom and this was just like it was relaxing so that was nice let's go make breakfast now okay for today's breakfast is going to be eggs and Greek yogurt okay guys so this is our breakfast we have five eggs with some salsa on top we got three yogurt vitamin sea water and a bunch of pills so we have vitamin D omega-3 creatine turmeric and magnesium all done let's get to work okay guys so it is 7:14 yeah we are going to go start working we have a 3-hour work block that we have a little break so yeah we are also going to create a priority list for the day that's something Mr Peterson does oh one other thing Andrew hubman he likes to delay his caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after he wakes up and it's currently 7:14 so so we pass that Mark so we can indulge in a little caffeine I'm actually really tired I think I got like 4 hours of sleep not the best I was waking up a lot but you know that's okay because Red Bull got me and yeah we got this we're going to take a 15-minute break I'm going to go outside so Andrew hubman is a super big advocate of going outside getting the sun especially when it's morning time just to get your security and Rhythm like there kind of so yeah for our 15-minute break I will be walking outside and then we have another 3-hour block of working so yay the walk is done it was really nice you did you like the walk oh I think he liked the walk it is currently 1 that means we are going to go to get lunch I'm going to go to my favorite Cafe I'm also going to be doing work there because I have another 3-hour block after lunch of just doing work and then I'm going to head to the gym yeah let's let's get going [Music] okay guys so we just finished um doing work at Divine coffee and those were like a really hard 3 hours like in the last hour I was just like struggling to stay awake like 5 hours of sleep is not usually like hard on me but I think it was the running in the morning and like all the stuff that I've been doing it's just like boom you know yeah I mean I have like like a 15-minute break before we get to the gym so I'm going to take a quick nap I'm so tired yeah okay I feel like I'm losing my mind is everybody in the world blind please Lord give me a side a [Music] sign I feel like I'm losing my mind is everybody in the world die please Lord give me a sh I want to be the greatest everybody on the face sh I look around I feel like everybody is the fakest I make this every day and I'm in patient hoping one day I blow up from the basement top okay so we just finished our workout we had a nice back and arm day yeah so also just one thing so this video is sponsored by Gym shark and I I just want to rep that gym shark is amazing I'm rocking the fit right now got the straight pants and a nice Stringer I'm telling you guys jym shark is it I'm soy you guys can use code Nicholas at your checkout to get 10% off just a quick announcement gym shark has officially released new colors of the Heritage collection as long as adding back the fan faves the Legacy and power collection so make sure you guys check them out gym shark actually has really nice lifestyle and gym clothes so you know I'm not saying this just because I'm sponsored like I literally have been wearing the clothes for years so definitely go check them out um yeah so let's go pose okay guys so we just finished with the gym now we're going to go eat then do our next work block so yeah I'll see you hey guys so it's 7:30 right now uh we got Caba so yeah we're going to we're going to eat that and we're also going to be doing work cuz we're a little behind schedule so we're just going to combine the two yeah um we have another 3-hour block until 10:30 uh hopefully this food will F me because that last 3-hour block was like torture I was just like dying trying to stay up but you know this is gonna be different because we got food so uh I'll see you guys in three hours it is 10:32 um we are done working I'm very tired but you know I'm actually really glad I feel really productive so that's good um yeah so I'm going to go do stretching now because David goggin lows to do stretching I think he does stretching for like two hours or something like that so yeah go ah him but we are going to do 30 minutes of stretching just so our body is completely loose okay guys so while we're doing the splits I'm going to give like a brief rundown on how I feel so you know I think overall this challenge is great it's like I got so much stuff done I think actually I would have got more done though if I got more sleep so that's the one thing I didn't follow through with the research because David gogin Andrew hubman Peterson they all have around 7 to 8 hours of sleep but I was like like nah I'm fine right cuz I usually get 5 hours of sleep anyways but I think it's because it's like the Running part and like just how much work you have to do you need to be more alert so you know if I would do this I would just dedicate like maybe two more hours to sleeping I call it the world's post productive day but not only in the aspect of like getting stuff done but in the aspect of being productive in your mental space and stuff like that so we really want to strike a really healthy balance of being really productive really healthy and really mentally good good you know I think that's what all Andrew hoerman George Peterson and David gokin are trying to get at I think I got 2 days worth of work in this one day so that's so good I would do this for a longer time period but I have school so this is not something that I can usually do but during summer you guys would like to see I will do this the whole summer totally content with that I'm just going to finish stretching we're going to get ready for bed and yeah the last thing we do before we go to sleep is just read so pretty nice 11:02 our stretching is done we're about to hop in a shower not a cold one this time it's going to be a nice warm shower and yeah we're going to go get ready for bed I'm really tired so I'm going to sleep so good tonight I already know it okay my day is done all we have to do now is just read a book and then go to sleep so actually I like how Ali abdal does this and I usually do this as well you just read a book until you fall asleep so there's like no pressure on how much you have to read just if you get hooked you keep going if you're really tired you can just sleep so that's that's how I love to do it so we're just going to read and then when I can barely open my eyes we will go to sleep okay guys so it's like 12:00 a.m. now and I'm really tired book was good but um yeah going to go to sleep now so overall this routine was great the total work time was 12 hours total exercise time was 1 hour 40 minutes total resting time including meditation eating stretching mental breaks Etc was 5 hours and 20 minutes and the total sleep time was 5 hours not bad at all and if you guys want to try this routine out here is the PDF it's also going to be in the link and bio so definitely check it out thank you so much for watching I'll see you guys in the next video bye
Eub7Jtn5chM,welcome my name is Nicholas burn and I'm a professional cor seller and finance Guru how many llc's do you have okay I'm just kidding I'm not becoming a finance Guru I will stay true to being a fitness YouTuber until the day I get a farm in Scotland and start teaching you guys how to harvest your carrots which you know might happen sooner than you think but I did want to make this video because I thought I had something I could say to really help improve you guys' life as a fellow teenager I understand the urge to start making money start self-improving start finding your direction I mean who doesn't want to start making money and start understanding this complicated Forest of life I mean I did and I still want to I might not be the most credible speaker on this subject but at age 17 I maintained a 97 average in all my classes got this physique and made tens of thousands of dollars all online with three different businesses I'm not saying this to F but to show you what's possible trust me I'm the most surprised out of anyone I mean I'm not a genius but I am someone who followed a couple Investments that led me here but not Investments with money with time and skills as teenag we time millionaires we have so much time and we just have to find out how to cultivate it and use it for our success and don't worry this is not some buy my course getrich quick scheme this is me genuinely trying to help you guys self-improve and in my opinion these Investments are worth so much more than your regular stock market or Drop Shipping investment especially when you don't have a lot of startup money so pay attention if you want I'll be breaking this up into three different parts investing in your health Knowledge and Skills let's get started first I want to start talking about investing in your health and what I mean by that is investing in working out or going to a gym I equate 90% of My Success due to the fact that I've been working out consistently for 5 years and yes it might be higher for me especially since I built a career off of being buff but it's more of the mentality changes and habits that you built you start to have the ability to hold yourself accountable to your life and to your body and this really helps you fulfill any goals you have for yourself you also get the sense of being in charge you dictate how your body looks and this is really important especially for teenagers because this is one of the first times you become fully independent also think about it like this if you can spend years working on your body you can spend years working on your future everything in the gym kind of just translate to life the gym also teaches you delayed gratification which I think is immensely important building a great body is like building a good future it won't come overnight but if you keep being consistent and putting the hard work in results will follow also just a quick sight tangent you get Hella confidence when you're buff you won't have to be insecure and just always worried about how you look once you're confident life is somewh better you can start going out with fitted teas and thinking you're the so just putting that out there and then of course there is the obvious you want to be healthy so you can live a long fulfilling life okay but genuinely going to the gym has done more for my mindset than anything else if you're struggling to find your direction in life I would recommend starting in the gym trust me I've seen so many people change their habits due to going to the gym it really is a spark that leads into a domino effect of just WIS and even if you don't figure out your direction by going into the gym at least you'll be buff would you rather be buff and lost or skinny or fat lost just think about it moving on to investing in knowledge but what do I even mean by this I mean investing time into books and learning from people you look up to I'm sure you heard the phrase that you are the middle of the five people you hang out with most and I think that's absolutely valid but what happens when you don't have a group of friends who have huge aspirations and similar goals as you do cut them out no you start surrounding yourself with like-minded people through books and through online resources don't reinvent the wheel you can learn from them and if you can really indulge and learn from these books you are on a path to success but let me reframe the word learn learning is not just about consuming knowledge it's about putting that knowledge into action so next time you read a book start actually putting that stuff into action but what books and people should you even listen to well we all have different goals but I'm assuming if you clicked on this video the best investments to make for teenagers I'm assuming you probably want to make money and start self-improving so for that I would recommend as my first book to read Atomic habits Atomic habits really shifts your mindset about self-improvement it really reinforces that small changes can lead to Big results and I think this is really good and it has done so much for me especially as the first book that I read about self-improvement of course a couple other books I would recommend is How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie the millionaire fast lane by MJ DeMarco and Feelgood productivity by Ali abdal I mean of course there are a bunch of other books but these are just the three main I would start off with and as for people to listen to I love listening to Alex heroi Ali abdal and Chris Williams they've done so much for me and put me in the right mindset of course there are so many other great people as well but these are the three that really stuck out to me and again it's not about watching or reading it's about actually putting that knowledge into use so you got it finally investing in skill and there are two main skills I want to talk about the first is investing in high income skills but what is a high income skill in today's society online businesses are flourishing and so are the jobs needed to grow these markets so skills like marketing selling content creation and coding are all super high income skills that are just going to flourish in the future and also just skills like speaking learning how to connect with others and being a leader are so indispensable the most valuable careers are in leadership and just like the stock market your skills will grow exponentially trust me future you will thank you so much if you start developing these skills now and finally the last skill I want to talk about is the skill of saying no and I'm still working on this if someone invites me to 2 a.m. Waffle House run it's pretty hard to say no but the ability to say no is so important don't let societal pressure or pure pressure influence you to do something stupid or something that you don't want to do if your friends always hang out 24/7 and they're inviting you out 24/7 and you know you have to get some work done say no I'm not saying to say no forever I think there are 100% times where you need to go out and get that Waffle House to really Forge close friendships but there are times when you really need a lock in and you just have to say no to a hangout or to any bad decision don't let others dictate your life take control okay we are done and if you found any value in that maybe I will become a finance Guru kidding but you know but yeah I hope you found some helpful insight to really start changing your life and remember you didn't learn anything from this video if you don't put it into action so good luck I'll be cheering you on anyways if you enjoyed the video let me know in the comments and yeah thank you for watching bye
